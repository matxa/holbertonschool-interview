0x0B. Menger sponge


The construction of a Menger sponge can be described as follows:

1. Begin with a cube.
2. Divide every face of the cube into nine squares, like Rubik's Cube. This sub-divides the cube into 27 smaller cubes.
3. Remove the smaller cube in the middle of each face, and remove the smaller cube in the very center of the larger cube, leaving 20 smaller cubes. This is a level-1 Menger sponge resembling a void cube).
5. Repeat steps two and three for each of the remaining smaller cubes, and continue to iterate ad infinitum.
